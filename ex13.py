from sys import argv

script, first, second, third = argv

print "The script is called:", script
print "Your first variable is:", first
print "Your second variable is:", second
print "Your third variable is:", third

#study drills
#less then 3 arguments means we get an error becuase argv doesnt have enough varibles to unpack and assign
